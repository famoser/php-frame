# phpFrame
The ultimate wrapper. The last PHP Framework I will ever do.

Php kind of sucks. You spend your time evaluating var_dump output, wondering why 0 + "test" does not equal "test" + 0 or why strlen and str_replace are named as they are named.
With this framework I can't help you with this. What I can do is enforce clean coding, and give you basic utilities which do most of the work you would have done in any project anyways.

I recommend, no I want you to use composer. If you've never used it before, lear about its awesome features here: https://getcomposer.org/

This Framework enforces the MVC pattern. Use it. 

As I myself hate and writing reading introductions, I've simply made some examples. See in the Examples folders. 

I will only include what I need in my day to day development of web applications. 
I will only provide high-level API's (as the DataService), and nothing which you can write in one hour for yourself.

Unfortunately I can not guarantee a "bug free experience", but I'm working on it.

Also, use laravel or similar if you want a real framework. I'm pretty sure they did a better job than I did with this one.
