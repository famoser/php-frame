# phpFrame
The last PHP Framework I will ever do.

This framework enforces clean coding, and give you basic utilities which do most of the work you would have done in any project anyways.

Please use composer: https://getcomposer.org/

This Framework enforces the MVC pattern. 

There are some examples in the Examples folders 

There are only high-level API's included (as the DataService), nothing which you can write in one hour for yourself.

Unfortunately I can not guarantee a "bug free experience", but I'm working on it.

Use symphony, slim (my favorite) or laravel if you want a real framework. I'm pretty sure they did a better job than I did with this one.
